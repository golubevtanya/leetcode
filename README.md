# Algorithms/Data Structures

:large_blue_diamond: This repo is created to keep track of algoruthm/data structure realted problems that I have tackled.
The sources of the problems are Leetcode and Stepik.  

  It is meant mainly for myself to store my solutions (might be inspired by solutions of others) accessible for myself, in case I want to refresh the ideas.  

|Not to forget: here is the link to the infamous [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).|
